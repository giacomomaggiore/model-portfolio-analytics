When I was in my fourth year of high school, <b>I bought my first shares</b>: a few hundred dollars split between Alibaba and Intel, knowing nothing about passive investing and with the  attitude of a teenager trying to make the very little savings from a few years of random casual jobs.

During my first years of Engineering, I started getting interested in markets and discovered the existence of ETFs. As a natural consequence, I began moving the piggy bank, which was starting to grow very slowly, into the most famous ETF of all: <a href="https://www.it.vanguard/investitori-privati/prodotti/etf/azionario/9679/ftse-all-world-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating" target="_blank">VWCE.</a>

After just over a year, in the middle of my romanticism for _"stocks for the long run",_ having grown up in a decade in which stocks had outperformed everything else and convinced that I had an incredibly long time horizon, I began allocating part of my portfolio to <b>daily leveraged ETFs</b>: first to the <a href="https://www.amundietf.it/it/professionali/products/equity/amundi-msci-usa-daily-2x-leveraged-ucits-etf-acc/fr0010755611" target="_blank">Amundi MSCI USA Daily (2x) Leveraged UCITS ETF Acc</a> _(being the only reasonable one available on Scalable Capital)_ and, _only after opening an IB account in Switzerland,_ to the <a href="https://www.amundietf.it/it/professionali/products/equity/amundi-msci-world-2x-leveraged-ucits-etf-acc/fr0014010hv4" target="_blank">Amundi MSCI World (2x) Leveraged UCITS ETF Acc</a>, bringing my leveraged allocation up to $50\%$ of the portfolio.

_(Quick note: although the word "leverage" may bring to mind extreme risk or speculation: <a href="https://giacomomaggiore.com/blog/10-leveraged-etf" target="_blank">studies show that, for long time horizons and "directional" markets, an "optimal" level of leverage exists</a> $> 1$ if you are willing to tolerate greater volatility in wealth in the short term.)_

### <b>You cannot pay rent with the long term</b>

Although this strategy may make sense for a <b>veeeery long time horizon</b>, two uncertainties changed my mind:
- <b>am I sure I have such a long time horizon?</b> Despite having a mum and dad ready to  support me financially, I do not really know what job I will do, where, or with whom I will be living in two years, _let alone in the long term..._ which is why it makes sense to consider the possibility that I may _(hopefully for as little time as possible)_ need to withdraw from my account, even just to invest in myself or maintain this lifestyle _(as frugal as you can be... rent in Zurich hits hard!)_
- having never experienced, _not even remotely,_ a sequence of years (let alone decades) of losses, how much does my preference for stocks <b>comes from the positive returns of the past decades?</b>


As a result, _rather temporarily and hastily,_ while keeping the leveraged ETF, I added a <b>short-duration bond ETF</b> for possible short-term expenses, following _(veeeery partially)_  the four-pillars philosophy of <a href="https://www.paolocoletti.com/" target="_blank">Prof Coletti</a> _(liquidity, emergency fund, bonds for expected expenses, stocks for the long term)._

However, since I started studying asset classes, correlations, and model portfolios a few months ago _(some nice resources are at the end of the article),_ I have increasingly appreciated the idea of taking a <b>more holistic view of the portfolio</b> _(some would call it the <a href="https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/research/reports/2026/total-portfolio-approach" target="_blank">Total Portfolio Approach</a>),_ thinking more in terms of risk factors than equity/geographic exposure.

The idea is that <b>different risk factors (asset classes) respond well to different market regimes.</b> Projecting and simplifying everything into four quadrants, defined by the combinations of high/low inflation and growth/recession, historical data show different returns depending on the relevant quadrant:

### <b>Filling the plate as much as possible</b>


With these assumptions, the classic $60/40$ is no longer enough: at least in an ideal world, it makes sense to include <b>other diversifiers</b> in the portfolio, which is why I decided to build my portfolio around the following asset classes:

- Global equities
- Global bonds
- Managed futures
- Commodity trend
- Gold
- Tail risk (deep OTM options)

Not wanting to sacrifice a $60/40$ exposure, to reduce my regrets when stocks and bonds take off, <b>return stacking</b> comes into play: a concept that lets you _"stack"_ additional sources of returns onto a traditional exposure, without having to divide up the space in an allocation that necessarily adds up to $100$.

According to this logic and through the use of <b>futures contracts</b>, it is therefore possible to have an exposure <b>greater than 1 for every EUR/USD/CHF invested.</b>

Suppose we have to invest $1$ and allocate it between bonds and stocks.<br/>
The classic approach involves investing $X \in [0,1]$ in stocks and $(1-X)$ in bonds.

With return stacking, you still invest an amount $X$ in stocks and add exposure to bonds _(or any other asset class)_ through futures contracts and the maintenance of collateral.<br/>
Usually, the collateral consists of the remaining $1-X$ as cash but, in some solutions, the portfolio as a whole can serve as collateral.


Although there is no explicit financing to buy bonds, the difference between margin and notional value represents <b>the implicit leverage in futures.</b><br/>
_For example,_ in a portfolio with stock exposure equal to $X$ and bond exposure equal to $(1-X)z$, with $z$ as the futures' implicit multiplier, the bond component gains/loses about $0{.}1z\%$ for a $0{.}1\%$ move in the underlying, ceteris paribus.




_(A semi-technical note: to maintain constant exposure, before each futures contract expires this strategy closes the position and opens an equivalent one with a later maturity (roll): in this way, returns depend both on changes in the underlying and on the cost/benefit of the roll.)_

Luckily, this logic does not need to be implemented manually: nowadays, multiple ETF providers offer financial instruments following this mechanism.


<a href="https://www.wisdomtree.com/it/products/equities/wisdomtree-global-efficient-core-ucits-etf---usd-acc" target="_blank">NTSG</a>, _for example_, the main ETF in my portfolio, for every dollar invested:

- allocates $X = 0.9$ to <b>global equities</b> in the traditional way _(applying, alas, an ESG filter...)_
- uses the remaining cash, $1 - X = 0.1$, as collateral for <b>global bond futures</b>, obtaining bond exposure of about 0.6 for each unit invested in the ETF.

As a result, the ETF represents a $90/60$ allocation to stocks and bonds.

Similarly, <a href="https://www.wisdomtree.com/us/products/capital-efficient/gde" target="_blank">the GDE ETF</a>:

- allocates $x = 0.9$ to <b>US large-cap equities</b>
- uses the remaining $1 - X = 0.1$ as cash collateral for <b>gold futures</b>, obtaining $90\%$ exposure to the underlying.

### <b>Ingredients, doses, and a pinch of <s>pepper</s> leverage</b>


To decide the portfolio weights, I started with a classic 60/40 and, by cross-referencing backtests and other <a href="https://theitalianleathersofa.com/model-portfolio/" target="_blank">Model Portfolio</a>, I weighted asset classes and alternative instruments as follows:

| ETF | Exposure | Allocation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NTSG | Global Equities + Global Bonds  | $60\%$ |
| COM | Commodities with trend following | $10\%$ |
| DBMF | Managed Features | $15\%$ |
| GDE | US Equities + Gold | $10\%$ |
| TAIL | Deep OTM options | $5\%$ |

which, in its vanilla version _(without further leverage/borrowing)_, produces the following exposures:

| Asset Class | Nominal exposure |
| --- | --- |
| Stocks | $63\%$ |
| Bonds | $36\%$ |
| Commodities | $10\%$ |
| Trend | $15\%$ |
| Gold | $9\%$ |
| Tail risk | $5\%$ |
| Total | $138\%$ |

_(Note that the total sum up to $> 100$ due to the use of implicit leverage)_

In addition, as a further parameter to turn up/down and modify the portfolio's risk/return profile, it is possible to take <b>cash on margin</b> _(borrow it)_, in my case rather easily through Interactive Brokers.

By doing so, the allocation changes by multiplying all exposures by a factor $L$, given by $L = (E+D)/E$, where $E$ is equity and $D$ is borrowed cash, subject to the constraint that $E > \text{maintenance requirement}$, calculated by the broker on the positions. In a simplification with a uniform maintenance margin $m$ and gross exposure $G$, $G/E < 1/m$ must therefore hold.<br/>
_($L$, $E$, and $D$ are not constants, but functions of the portfolio's returns and therefore vary over time.)_

Consequently, my exposure is:

| Asset Class | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Stocks (Global + US Equities) | $(0{.}9 \times \%_{NTSG} + 0{.}9 \times \%_{GDE}) \times L$ |
| Bonds (US Treasury)| $(0{.}6 \times \%_{NTSG}) \times L$ |
| Commodities | $\%_{COM} \times L$ |
| Trend following | $\%_{DBMF} \times L$ |
| Gold | $(0{.}9 \times \%_{GDE}) \times L$ |
| Tail risk | $\%_{TAIL} \times L$ |

Setting, for example, $L=1{.}3$, the portfolio becomes:

| Asset Class | Without IB leverage | Effective with $L=1{.}3$ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stocks (Global + US Equities) | $63\%$ | $81{.}9\%$ |
| Bonds (US Treasury) | $36\%$ | $46{.}8\%$ |
| Commodities | $10\%$ | $13{.}0\%$ |
| Trend following | $15\%$ | $19{.}5\%$ |
| Gold | $9\%$ | $11{.}7\%$ |
| Tail risk | $5\%$ | $6{.}5\%$ |
| <b>Total</b> | $138\%$ | $179{.}4\%$ |
<br/>
---

Although my portfolio has changed a lot in recent years, because of my greater awareness and knowledge of the matter, I will not deny that there are still many aspects that do _NOT_ convince me and that require further study _(first and foremost: that damn ESG filter and exposure to US Treasuries),_ but <b>that is another story!</b>

To sum up... I realize that these formulations and complications are far from the _"VWCE and chill..."_ philosophy and are not suited to most retail investors, but:
1. this is mostly an exercise in style with a "useful" practical upside
2. I enjoy it quite a lot
3. this is not financial advice.

Cheers

### <b>Technical Appendix </b>

### <b>A.1 - Questions and limits of private wealth management</b>

A few hours after publishing this article _(28 September 2026, 18:00),_ a close friend raised the following question:

<Quote>
Where does the portfolio described here stand with respect to the distinction between <b>private wealth management</b> and <b>professional securities trading</b>?
</Quote>

_For those unfamiliar with Swiss taxation:_ this classification has an important practical consequence:
- under private wealth management, capital gains from selling securities held as private assets <b>are exempt from income tax</b> _(in short: NO capital gains tax!)_
- if the activity is classified as professional securities trading, the gains are income from self-employment and are therefore included in taxable income _(in short: they are added to the annual income on which taxes are calculated)_

The <a href="https://www.estv.admin.ch/dam/de/sd-web/oOz28af293pZ/dbst-ks-2012-1-036-d-de.pdf" target="_blank">Circolare ESTV n. 36</a> sets out an initial assessment and <b>rules out professional securities trading</b> when <b>all</b> of the following conditions are met:
1. the securities sold have been held for at least six months;
2. the annual transaction volume _(the sum of purchase prices and sale proceeds)_ does not exceed five times the value of securities and cash at the beginning of the tax period;
3. realized capital gains are not needed to replace missing income for living expenses _(as a rule, this condition is met if the gains are lower than $50\%$ of the net income for the tax period)_;
4. investments are not financed with third-party capital, or the taxable income from securities _(interest and dividends)_ exceeds the interest expense proportionally attributable to the debt;
5. the purchase and sale of derivatives are limited to hedging the investor's own securities positions.

Failing to meet one of these conditions removes the initial exclusion, but <b>does not automatically</b> make the investor a professional trader _(in that case, the authority assesses the situation individually)._

In particular, for the portfolio described here:
- the futures held within NTSG and GDE do not represent personal debt or derivatives transactions made directly by the investor, as they are fund holdings.
- margin borrowing, _on the other hand,_ represents third-party capital and makes it necessary to check condition 4. For this purpose, I suggest the following <b>simplified model</b>.

Let:

- $E_0$ be the initial equity
- $D_0$ be the margin debt
- $L = (E_0 + D_0)/E_0 \ge 1$ be the portfolio's explicit leverage
- $V_0 = L E_0$ be the invested capital
- $y_p$ be the ratio between the annual gross taxable income from securities and $V_0$;
- $i$ be the effective annual cost of debt, including the broker's spread ($\approx \text{Benchmark} + \text{Spread}$).

Since $D_0 = (L-1)E_0$, _under the simplifying assumptions that leverage, taxable return, and interest rate stay constant,_ condition 4 is met when:

$$
V_0 y_p \ge D_0 i
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
L E_0 y_p \ge (L-1)E_0 i.
$$

After simplifying $E_0$, if $i>y_p$, we obtain the <b>maximum leverage level compatible</b> with the condition:

$$
L \le L^*(i)=\frac{i}{i-y_p}.
$$

_On the other hand,_ if $i\le y_p$, the condition is met $\forall L\ge1$.

Equivalently, for $L>1$, the maximum rate is:

$$
i \le i^*(L)=\frac{L}{L-1}y_p.
$$

</div>

### <b>A.2 - Time horizons and optimal leverage ratios </b>

Still responding to my friend's message, I naturally asked myself:

<Quote>
Assuming classification as a professional investor _(trader)_ and a non-zero capital gains tax, for which combinations of leverage $L$, horizon $T$, cost of debt $i$, and effective tax rate $t$ does the net wealth of the leveraged strategy exceed that of private wealth management _(without leverage)_ with no capital gains tax?
</Quote>

The comparison therefore combines two different cases:
- Scenario A: the same portfolio with explicit leverage $L > 1$ and capital gains tax $t$
- Scenario B: a portfolio with explicit leverage $L = 1$ _(i.e. no margin debt)_ and no capital gains tax

Let:

- $E_0$ be the initial equity
- $T$ be the time horizon, expressed in years
- $r_p$ be the annual compound return of the portfolio without explicit leverage
- $L=(E+D)/E>1$ be explicit leverage _(kept constant throughout $T$)_
- $i$ be the annual cost of margin financing
- $t$ be the total effective tax rate _(applied only to the capital gain in the professional scenario)_
- $V_t^s$ be the portfolio value at time $t$ before taxes, in scenario $s=A,B$
- $E_t^s$ be the equity at time $t$ _(after taxes)_, in scenario $s=A,B$


In Scenario A, the investor uses leverage $L>1$ and their annual return on equity is, _before taxes:_

$$
r_e(L)=Lr_p-(L-1)i
=r_p+(L-1)(r_p-i).
$$

Wealth at $T$ is, _before capital gains tax_:

$$
V_T^A=E_0\left[1+r_e(L)\right]^T.
$$

Assuming that the entire capital gain is realized and taxed only at $T$, we get:

$$
E_T^A=V_T^A-t\max\left(0,V_T^A-E_0\right).
$$

Which, when $V_T^A>E_0$, becomes

$$
E_T^A=E_0\left\{(1-t)
\left[1+r_p+(L-1)(r_p-i)\right]^T+t\right\}.
$$

In Scenario B, the investor does not use margin ($L=1$) and pays no capital gains tax:

$$
E_T^B=E_0(1+r_p)^T.
$$

_Therefore,_ the leveraged strategy is beneficial if and only if:

$$
E_T^A>E_T^B
$$

which, _after substitution,_ becomes:

$$
(1-t)\left[1+r_p+(L-1)(r_p-i)\right]^T+t
>(1+r_p)^T.
$$

Solving the equation for $i$ gives the <b>maximum cost of debt</b> for which the leveraged strategy is beneficial:

$$
i^*
=r_p-\frac{1}{L-1}
\left[
\left(\frac{(1+r_p)^T-t}{1-t}\right)^{1/T}
-(1+r_p)
\right].
$$

The model is deliberately <b><s>over</s> simplified</b>: it assumes <b>constant</b> returns, borrowing costs, leverage, and tax rates; it <b>does not consider</b> volatility, margin calls, currency changes, taxes paid in the intervening years, and many other real-world complexities. <b>CAGR cannot be leveraged linearly when volatility is present.</b>

---

_For illustration only,_ consider the following numerical examples:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Initial equity $E_0$ | $100'000$ |
| Annual portfolio return $r_p$ | $8{.}0\%$ |
| Annual margin cost $i$ | $5{.}5\%$ |
| Explicit leverage $L$ | $1{.}3$, $1{.}5$, $2{.}0$ |
| Horizon $T$ | $10$, $20$, $30$ years |
| Effective tax rate $t$ | $20\%$, $28\%$, $35\%$ |

The final wealth values, _rounded to the nearest unit,_ are:

| $L$ | $T$ | scenario B | scenario A, $t=20\%$ | scenario A, $t=28\%$ | scenario A, $t=35\%$ |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| $1{.}3$ | $10$ | $215'892$ | $205'090$ | $194'581$ | $185'386$ |
| $1{.}3$ | $20$ | $466'096$ | $448'228$ | $413'405$ | $382'935$ |
| $1{.}3$ | $30$ | $1'006'266$ | $1'010'759$ | $919'683$ | $839'992$ |
| $1{.}5$ | $10$ | $215'892$ | $213'778$ | $202'400$ | $192'445$ |
| $1{.}5$ | $20$ | $466'096$ | $489'374$ | $450'436$ | $416'366$ |
| $1{.}5$ | $30$ | $1'006'266$ | $1'156'929$ | $1'051'236$ | $958'755$ |
| $2{.}0$ | $10$ | $215'892$ | $237'126$ | $223'414$ | $211'415$ |
| $2{.}0$ | $20$ | $466'096$ | $609'299$ | $558'369$ | $513'805$ |
| $2{.}0$ | $30$ | $1'006'266$ | $1'619'405$ | $1'467'464$ | $1'334'516$ |

and, _as a percentage relative to Scenario B:_

| $L$ | $T$ | $t=20\%$ | $t=28\%$ | $t=35\%$ |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| $1{.}3$ | $10$ | $-5{.}00\%$ | $-9{.}87\%$ | $-14{.}13\%$ |
| $1{.}3$ | $20$ | $-3{.}83\%$ | $-11{.}30\%$ | $-17{.}84\%$ |
| $1{.}3$ | $30$ | $+0{.}45\%$ | $-8{.}60\%$ | $-16{.}52\%$ |
| $1{.}5$ | $10$ | $-0{.}98\%$ | $-6{.}25\%$ | $-10{.}86\%$ |
| $1{.}5$ | $20$ | $+4{.}99\%$ | $-3{.}36\%$ | $-10{.}67\%$ |
| $1{.}5$ | $30$ | $+14{.}97\%$ | $+4{.}47\%$ | $-4{.}72\%$ |
| $2{.}0$ | $10$ | $+9{.}84\%$ | $+3{.}48\%$ | $-2{.}07\%$ |
| $2{.}0$ | $20$ | $+30{.}72\%$ | $+19{.}80\%$ | $+10{.}24\%$ |
| $2{.}0$ | $30$ | $+60{.}93\%$ | $+45{.}83\%$ | $+32{.}62\%$ |

_Under these assumptions,_ the benefit of moderate leverage depends heavily on the tax rate and $T$:
- with $L=1{.}3$, it only appears at $T = 30$ and $t=20\%$
- increasing leverage to $L=1{.}5$ makes it appear sooner and across more combinations.
- the benefit increases as $L$ rises but, _precisely in these cases,_ <b>the risks excluded from the model become more relevant!</b>
